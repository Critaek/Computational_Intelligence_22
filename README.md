The .ipynb is still there just to have the problem description, the solution is in the .py file.

N = 5 -> total length = 5 / nodes = ? / 1,175 states visited <br />
N = 10 -> total length = 10 / nodes = ? / 160,922 states visited <br />
N = 20 -> total length = 28 / nodes = ? / 2,807,347 states visited <br />
N = 100 -> Memory error (16gb machine) <br />
N = 500 -> Memory error <br />
