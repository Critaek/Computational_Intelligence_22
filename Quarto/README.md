Code to play Quarto. The MyPlayer file contains my implementation of the minmax algorithm, with alpha beta pruning and a cache.

The Utils file contains two functions, one to load the cache (it's then used when creating the MyPlayer), and another one to save the cache.
The cache is saved in the Cache folder with pickle.

Reviews done by me:

As said in the report, there was a misunderstanding on my part so I only done one for the lab 1 and 2, so I chose to do more on the lab 3 in order to have the expected 6 reviews.
